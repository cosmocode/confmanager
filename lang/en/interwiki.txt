The original idea of InterWiki was to have one large distributed [[wp>Wiki]] over the whole net. Today its more of an easy way to link from one wiki to another by having some simple link syntax to do so.

In [[doku>DokuWiki]] this is done by prefixing Wiki [[doku>pagenames]] with a shortcut separated by a ''>'' character.

Examples:
<code>
[[wp>Wiki]] links to Wikipedia,
[[Meatball>TourBusStop]] links to the MeatBall wiki TourBusStop,
[[google>Wiki]] links to a Google search,
[[doku>interwiki]] links to this page
</code>

[[wp>Wiki]] links to Wikipedia, [[Meatball>TourBusStop]] links to the MeatBall wiki TourBusStop, [[google>Wiki]] links to a Google search.
[[doku>interwiki]] links to this page.

There is one special interwiki shortcut called **''this''**. It always links to the webserver directory DokuWiki is installed in. You can use this to construct relative URLs. For example the following always links to the local [[doku>syndication|XML feed]]: [[this>feed.php]]

<code>
[[this>feed.php]]
</code>
