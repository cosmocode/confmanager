[[doku>DokuWiki]] can replace certain characters or strings with other strings based on a configuration file. By default this is used to convert various character combinations to their typographical equivalent.

e.g.

<code>
<<  to «
>>  to »
=>  to ⇒
</code>

see also [[doku>syntax#text_to_html_conversions]].

Even though by default it is used with simple character replacements only, the entity system can also be used to insert more complex constructs into your pages. This includes HTML. However you should be aware that doing so is bound to break when used in combination with non-HTML renderers.
