Which file types you can upload via the [[doku>mediamanager]] is configured through the ''conf/mime.conf'' file. It also configures the file extension <-> mimetype association.

For security reasons it is not possible to configure [[doku>DokuWiki]] to allow any file type.

:!: **Never enable HTML upload for unprotected wikis**, as this opens Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities through JavaScript. Only enable this with trusted users. You need to disable the [[doku>config:iexssprotect]] option additionally to adding the HTML mime type in the config file.

Additional icons in a similar style are available at http://www.splitbrain.org/projects/file_icons

You can find any file extension with it's mime at http://filext.com/
